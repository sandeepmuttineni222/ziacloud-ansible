General Support Statement
=========================

This ZIA Ansible Collection Module is supported and maintained by the Zscaler Technology Alliances team in partnership with Zscaler's engineering,
and we welcome questions on how to use the collection.
Please refer to our :doc:`troubleshooting guide <troubleshooting>` for guidance on typical problems.

Support Ticket Severity
-----------------------

Support tickets related to this Ansible Collection can be opened with `Zscaler Support <https://help.zscaler.com/login-tickets>`_, however, since the collection is just a client of the underlying product API,
we will **NOT** be able to treat ansible-related support requests as a Severity-1 (Immediate time frame).

When reporting bugs, please provide the Ansible playbook that demonstrates the bug and the command output. Tracebacks are also helpful.

Notice that we will **NOT**, however, fix bugs upon customer demand, as we have to prioritize all pending bugs and features, as part of the product's backlog and release cycles.

Urgent, production-related Ansible issues can be resolved via direct interaction with the underlying API or UI. We will ask customers to resort to these methods to resolve downtime or urgent issues.

If you have an urgent escalation, please contact your local Zscaler account team (RSM/SE/CSM/TAM) for assistance.
